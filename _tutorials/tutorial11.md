        # Dataset & Chart

        Weather data of four cities (Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, and Seattle) collected from the National Centers for Environmental Information.

        In this tutorial we create a small multiples showing the temprature and precipitation in four cities using a weather radial chart template (created with Charticulator).
