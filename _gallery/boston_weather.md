Here we use Charticulator to create a [Weather Radial](http://www.weather-radials.com/) visualization, designed by Raureif GmbH.

A radial chart displaying the temperature and rainfall in Boston over the course of a year.
Each line represents a single day's minimum and maximum temperature. Lines are colored by the average temperature.
The blue circles represents the amount of rainfall.
